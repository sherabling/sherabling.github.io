        <p>Palpung is the Karma Kagyu mother monastery in Eastern Tibet, and has more than 180 branch monasteries and
            temples throughout several Chinese and Tibetan districts. Students from these branch monasteries travel to
            Palpung Monastery to study ritual, art, retreat practices, and scholarly texts.

            The current seat of the 12th Kenting Tai Situpa in India, palpung Sherabling, has been renamed Palpung
            Sherabling monastic seat.

            The present 12th Kenting Tai Situpa also founded the Maitreya Institutes around the world, including
            branches in San Francisco, Paris, London and Honolulu. In this web site, Palpung monastery and Palpung
            Sherabling are presented.</p>

        <p>The 8th Kenting Tai Situpa Chokyi Jugne founded the great Palpung monastery in 1727. "Pal" means glorious,
            "Pung" means to gather. For this reason the name Palpung, derived from the combination of the two words has
            been applied to the institution. Palpung means glorious union of study and practice.

            Palpung Monastery is the seat of the succeeded Kenting Tai Situpas, the religious center of eastern Tibet,
            as well as the centre for living art and culture.</p>
