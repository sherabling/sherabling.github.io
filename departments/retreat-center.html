        monks, apartments for visiting teachers, and a shrine hall.

    <p class="Purple-text">
        First group was started in 1989 with the blessing of late Kyabje Kalu Rinpoche and late very venerable Saljay
        Rinpoche. Very Venerable Saljay Rinpoche was the retreat master for the first retreat, and Mingyur Rinpoche for
        the succeeding ones. Lama Tsultrim, a very venerable lama who has spent most of his life in retreats, (including
        retreats with the previous Kalu Rinpoche in Palpung Monastery), has been the Master of Discipline, spiritual
        guide, and also teaches the retreat participants practical application. </p>
