<p>The monastic college, Palpung Sherabling Institute of Higher Buddhist Studies (Tib. Lung-Rig Jampal Ling), was the first building in Palpung Sherabling, built in 1977 to house 50 monks serving as the monastery, college, school, and dispensary. In 1984 it was expanded with a second floor. Following restoration the Shedra have moved in from their temporary residence in the main monastery.</p>
 <p>
  It contains a shrine hall, 35 dormitory rooms, classrooms, a dispensary, library, reception rooms and apartments for the resident incarnate lamas. There are about 150 students learning here. To join the Shedra one must commit to stay for at least 7 years (the basic course), and throughout the 15hr day one must be willing to study, debate, and learn wholeheartedly. There is one day, Thursday, off each week.</p>

<p>Now (2007) in the Institute there are three Khenpos as main teachers. Before 2007, among other teachers, three Khenpos are introduced here:</p>
