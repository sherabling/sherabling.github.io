<p>In 1975, the present 12th Kenting Tai Situpa's disciples from Derge and Nangchen region who settled in Bir, Himachal Pardesh Northern India, donated a protected pine forested land located in the foothills of the Himalayas. Here he started to establish Palpung Sherabling, which later became his seat in India. The building was designed by Kenting Tai Situpa, and is built of modern materials and finished in traditional Tibetan architectural fashion. The concept of the design follows the ancient science of geomancy. Palpung Sherabling cultivates and preserves the artistic lineage of the Palpung tradition. The monastery, only a few miles from the nearest town, retains its calmness and isolation.</p>

  <p>Palpung Sherabling is composed of several units. Monks or Nuns in each of these units may have very different daily schedules.</p>
<p>Some monks in the main monastery are called "prayer monks". They are responsible for the daily, monthly and annual prayers in the monastery, as well as any special prayers that have been requested. In their prayer-free time they learn the ritual life of the monk through practical experience, including playing instruments, making torma offerings, lama dancing, special chanting, hand gestures and memorizing prayers. When a monk is adept at these studies, they may choose to enter the shedra (monastic collage), or the three-year retreat.</p>
